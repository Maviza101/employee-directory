The goal of this exercise is to test knowledge of Javascript and
Angular. It is also about testing skills of modeling a new or an old
project.

Task: convert this Angular.JS application into Angular without adding
or removing any feature. Ideally, you should spend a maximum of 2
hours on this exercise.

Keep in mind:
* Good coding practices.
* Design is not the primary goal of this test although it is important
  to understand how it impacts the application.
