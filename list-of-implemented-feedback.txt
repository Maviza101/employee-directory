# Good
- Creation of typings
- CDN for images
- Reusable code splitted in utilities
- Good organization of components
- Using of css flex property
- App is responsive for smaller screens

# Could be done better
- Using of reactive programming
- [DONE. Thanks to https://blog.thoughtram.io/angular/2016/10/10/resolving-route-data-in-angular-2.html] Routing and data resolvers _[didn't have experience with Angular 8]_
- [UNUSABLE. Used a for so as to be able to break early] Simple `for` loops that can be replaced by filter and reduce
- [DONE. Update might be a tad less efficient but it's more realistic for when employees are dynamically loaded from an API instead of being a pre-stated list] For user search he is converting the full employees object into a string and matching the user input against that. (Not so elegant solution)
- [DONE. Added a named router-outlet as a secondary outlet that adds a footer to all pages.] Using of named routerOutlets (Advanced solution) _[didn't have experience with Angular 8]_

# Missing features
- [TODO: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JA90VI9fAI] Animations (very easy to do with Angular route animations) _[didn't have experience with Angular 8]_

# Bonus features
- No bonus features implemented 

My own todos after acting on the above:
- TODO: Use a data resolver for the reports page too.
